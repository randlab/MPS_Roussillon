# Training Image (TI)

Valentin Dall'Alba / February 2020

## Description :

A TI represents a conceptual representation of the simulated objects. The TIs are created in collaboration with the geologists of the project and by trial and error ajustement. Different TIs were tested during the project. The selection of the TI is based on the visual aspect of the test simulation outputs (cf : _jupyter/01_ti.ipynb_).

The TI files are gslib files with two variables. The first variable is the facies, the second one is the trend.

## Files : 

* _ti_concept.gslib_ : Represents a classical alluvial plain system.

* _ti_analogue_IT.gslib_ : Represents an analogue model inspire by a river system in northern Italia.

* _ti_roussillon.gslib_ : Creates by the geologists and in respect with the general knowledge of the plain.

# Simulation Outputs

Valentin Dall'Alba / February 2020

## Description : 

The simulations outputs are note store on git hub due to the size of the files. For access to the data outputs please send an email to *valentin.dallalba-arnau@unine.ch*

The outputs folder contains simulations and post simulations outputs of the Roussillon MPS model. The probability maps and the entropy map are the only calculated from the simulation set using the vertical sampling approach.

## Files : 

* _simu_MPS.gslib_ : simulations set using the vertical sampling approach.
* _simu_MPS_withoutSampling.gslib_ :  simulations set, which not use the vertical sampling approach.
* _simu_MPS_probability.gslib_ : probability maps of each facies calculated from the set of simulation using the vertical sampling approach.
* _simu_MPS_entropy.gslib_ : entropy map calculated from the probability map for the set of simulation using the vertical sampling approach.

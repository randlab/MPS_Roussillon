# Hard data

Valentin Dall'Alba / February 2020

## Description :

This folder contains the csv file of the hard data use for the MPS simulations. There is two data sets that condition the simulation, the first one is created based on the interpretation of gamma-ray and resistivity logs and the second one is created based on the geological map. Both set are proposed in RGF93 coordinates system. For each set there is a corresponding "transfo" set. These sets are transposed along the _z_ axis in the simulation grid (flattened space).

More information can be found in the document _hd_roussillon.pdf_, that described the interpretation process of the hard data.

## Files :

* _hd_geol_RGF93.csv_ : from the geological map.

* _hd_geol_RGF93_transfo.csv_ : from the geological map, transposed in _z_ to the simulation grid.

* _hd_diag_RGF93.csv_ : from the interpreted boreholes.

* _hd_diag_RGF93_transfo.csv_ : from the interpreted boreholes, transposed in _z_ to the simulation grid.

* *hd_merge_transfo.csv* : merge data set in the transposed altitude.

* _hd_roussillon.pdf_ : description of the interpretation and hard data sets creation.
